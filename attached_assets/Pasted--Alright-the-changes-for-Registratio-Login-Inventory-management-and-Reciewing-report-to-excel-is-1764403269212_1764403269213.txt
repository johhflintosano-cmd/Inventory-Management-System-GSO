
Alright the changes for Registratio, Login, Inventory management, and Reciewing report to excel is great!!!

BEFORE ACTION, STATE YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND LET ME CHECK PHASES and CHECKLIST ACTIONS FIRST AND I WILL SAY "PROCEED" if its good to go.
Now ill be adding a new function, "RELEASED ORDER REPORT"

CONTEXT: Since our client has a recieving of items report from an employee that bought in new items, the items get taken out from the ware house, when its finally goinf to be used-.
so our client would love a release report where it also list all the items that will be taken including their details and estimated cost-

so how this will work: 
when the employee or admin searches through the items and clicks on them like saving an item in a shopping cart (the button to see the list of items picked will not look like a shopping cart but it will say "Items picked"
while clicking on the said item it will show "How much quantity?" 
they will insert how many wil be taken if the said number is within- 
if too much was demanded more the available quantity show-> 
IF EMPLOYEE "insufficient items, notify admin?" IF they CLICK approve and not deny- 
then the notifaction that the items are not enough will be sent to admin in the notification interface.
 IF ADMIN just say insificient items.

Now after finsihing picking what they need they will click in the button "ITEMS PICKED" and will auto show all details like- (TEMPLATE WILL BE SHOWN LATER: note: "particulars" means "Items delivered" from the receiving input)
and it will auto show the whole estimate of all items that will be taken out (IF EMPLOYEE-> NEED APPROVAL BEFORE ACCES TO GENERATE RELEASED ORDER REPORT just like the recieving input- admin can check or deny certain items or pick all. IF ADMIN- AUTO REDIRECT TO ACCESS RELEASED ORDER REPORT)
THEN EXPORT ALL ITEMS LISTED and items will autofill details on the template given (make sure to check logic of the template and connect details as so)
AND WHEN FINNALY HIT THE EXPORT BUTTON- make sure to to trigger REMOVE ITEMS FROM DB AND UPDATE FRONTEND AND UI IN ACCORDING TO THE CHNAGE. and just like the release repoort

WHEN HIT GENERATE REPORT_ MAKE INTP A DONWLOADABLE EXCEL FILE WITH THE TEMPLATE AND ITEM DETAILS. AND RESET AFTER NEW SET OF ITEMS
Ps. USE THE EXACT EXCEL TEMPLATE I GAVE YOU_ EXACT DETAILS AND EVEN EXCEL ORIENTATION AND DESIGNED IN THE FILE-
ps. DO NOT REMOVE THE RECEIVING REPORT FUNCTION OR DONT EVEN REWRITE IT_ THIS IS MERELY AN ADDITION TO THE SYSTEM:

IF BUTTON PICKED "REICEIVING REPORT" GO TO RELEASE REPORT ORIENTATION FILE
IF BUTTON PICKED "RELEASED ORDER REPORT:" FO TO RELEASED ORDER REPORT ORIENTATION FILE- (IF EMPLOYEE AND THEY PICKED THIS BUTTON WITH NO APPORVAL YET- WHEN CLICKED SUBMIT REQUEST- BUT IF ALREADY APPROVED BY ADMIN- LET THEM ACCES GENERATE REPORT ADN FILE)

(PS. NO need for approval per action IF ADMIN- auto access and auto direct to function)
